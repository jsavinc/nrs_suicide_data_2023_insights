# Load data
  
Note: this is based on the 2022 data release, reporting on probable deaths by suicide up to 2021.
I'm assuming the 2023 format will be the same as 2022, so I can swap out for the later file once it's released here.

```{r}
url_2022 <- "https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/probable-suicides/2021/suicides-21-all-tabs.xlsx"

# TODO: change once it's available!
url_2023 <- "https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/probable-suicides/2022/suicides-22-all-tabs.xlsx"

if (!dir.exists("./data/")) dir.create("./data")

download.file(url = url_2022, destfile = file.path("./data", basename(url_2022)), mode = "wb")

# TODO: load separate sheets as required
data_2022 <- read_excel(path = file.path("./data", basename(url_2022)))
```
